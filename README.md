## Setup and Deployment
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nashon-juma.github.io/port2.git 
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd port2
   ```
3. **Open Locally**:
   Open `index.html` in a browser to view the portfolio.
4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   - Push the repository to GitHub.
   - Go to the repository settings, enable GitHub Pages, and select the `main` branch.
   - Access the live site at `https://nashon-juma.github.io/port2`.
5. **Deploy to Netlify**:
   - Create a Netlify account and drag the project folder into the Netlify dashboard.
   - Alternatively, connect your GitHub repository to Netlify for automatic deployment.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file with the portfolio structure.
- `style.css`: CSS file with all styling, including responsive design and animations.
- `cv.pdf`: Placeholder for your CV file (replace with your actual CV).

## Customization
- **Update Content**: Edit `index.html` to include your personal details, project links, and CV.
- **Styling**: Modify `style.css` variables (e.g., `--primary-color`, `--secondary-color`) for color scheme changes.
- **Links**: Update GitHub and LinkedIn links in the footer and project section.

## Notes
- The contact form is styled for accessibility but requires a backend (e.g., PHP) for functionality, which is not included due to the competition's HTML/CSS constraint.
- Ensure the `nashonjuma.pdf` file is in the project root for the download link to work.
- The design avoids external libraries to meet competition requirements, relying solely on raw HTML and CSS.
